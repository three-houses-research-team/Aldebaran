# Aldebaran, based on [Skyline](https://github.com/shadowninja108/Skyline)
An environment for linking, runtime hooking and code patching in Fire Emblem Three Houses. Fork of Skyline, a modding framework for Super Smash Bros Ultimate.

# Why the rename?
To make sure people make the distinction between the original Skyline and the FETH fork. Also serves to make a distinction with Starfall, the previous modding environment based on Starlight.

# Current limitations
- Consider this WIP and rushed
- TCP logging needs to be configurable

# How to install
- Put the content of the archive at the root of your SD
- Put the files you want to replace in sd:/Aldebaran/forge/, with the entry ID as the name in decimal and no extension. (Like Starfall)
